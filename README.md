This is a simple Image Gallery app. Also have multiple transformation in full view. Give it a try. Comments are welcome. Anybody wants to contribute are also welcome. I want to develop a full fledged customized gallery appp.
This App shows all the images present in your entire device in a single grid view. On clicking on particular gridview it launches a fullscreen activity where u can watch the full view of that image, also you can choose custom transformations.
